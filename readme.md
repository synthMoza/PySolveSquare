## What is this?  
This is a simple program to solve the square equation written Python just for practice.
## How to use?   
Write the coefficients of the square equation *(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)* and wait for the answer in the console.
## How it works?   
At first, program takes the coefficients and transform them into a nice-looking equation string with the method ```get_cf_str()``` and ```exp_print()```. Then the method ```solveSquare()``` does its job written in the name of this function, and runs the method ```solveLinear()``` if it's necessary (hope the conditions are obvious). At the end the program prints the result with the method ```print_roots()```(the amount of roots, their values).
### Special thanks   
I want to say a big thanks to the person who wrote this code - myself.
